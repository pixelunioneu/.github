## 🧭 Our Mission

In an era of shifting geopolitics and data-hungry platforms, we believe Europeans deserve a "safe harbor" for their digital lives. Our goal is to bridge the gap between complex self-hosted solutions and convenient consumer apps.

* **Privacy First:** No tracking, no ads, and no data mining.
* **EU-Based:** All data is stored on European soil, governed by GDPR and European privacy standards.
* **Open Foundations:** We don't believe in "black boxes." Our platform is built on and contributes back to the best open-source photo management software.
